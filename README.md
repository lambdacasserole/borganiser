# Borganiser

Borganiser is a lightweight, efficient utility designed to clean, sort, and organise BibTeX bibliographies. It's particularly useful for students and researchers looking to streamline their references in their theses or publications. With Borganiser, you can easily sort your BibTeX entries and their fields alphabetically, ensuring your bibliography is neatly formatted and consistently ordered.

## Features

- **Clean and Sort**: Strips unnecessary whitespace and sorts your BibTeX entries and fields.
- **User-friendly**: Simple interface, just run the script with your `.bib` file.
- **Customizable**: Easy to modify and adapt to your specific formatting rules.

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/lambdacasserole/borganiser.git
```

Navigate into the project directory:

```
cd borganiser
```

Borganiser is a Python-based utility. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

## Usage

1. Place your `.bib` file in the same directory as the Borganiser script.
2. Run the script with your `.bib` file as input:

```
python borganiser.py main.bib
```

3. The script will print the sorted BibTeX entries to the console. You can redirect this output to a file:

```
python borganiser.py main.bib > sorted_main.bib
```

4. Replace your original `.bib` file with `sorted_main.bib` (or merge changes as needed).
